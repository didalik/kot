# Stellar Help Exchange + Cloudflare Job Fair = kloudoftrust.org!

**Stellar Help Exchange** is an equitable cloud-based marketplace where you exchange all kinds of help for HEXA - Help EXchange Asset. If you don't get the help you paid for, you get your HEXA back, and the help provider's reputation suffers. Stellar Help Exchange runs on [Stellar](https://stellar.com/).

**Cloudflare Job Fair** is a place where all types of Job Requests meet all kinds of Job Agents. When an Agent gets authorized to do a Job, the job becomes a Help Exchange item with a certain amount of HEXA assigned to it. Runs on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
