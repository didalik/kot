# Stellar Help Exchange + Cloudflare Job Fair = Proof of Concept

**Stellar Help Exchange (hX)** is an equitable cloud-based marketplace where you exchange all kinds of help for HEXA - my Help EXchange Asset. If you don't get the help you paid for, you get your HEXA back, and the help provider's reputation suffers. Stellar Help Exchange runs on [Stellar](https://stellar.com/).

**Cloudflare Job Fair (jF)** is a place where all types of Job Requests meet all kinds of Job Agents. When an Agent gets authorized to do a Job, the job becomes an hX item with a certain amount of HEXA assigned to it. It runs on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

These are my hobby projects. Combined, they make it possible for me and you to use the Internet for fun and profit. Presently, **jF** provides global access to the **hX + jF** proof of concept demo from [kloudoftrust.org](https://kloudoftrust.org).

The **hX + jF** concept can be applied to both the real world and the Internet. Some real-world examples could be open-sourced (AirBnb | Uber)-like applications. The digital world applications look more promising, as delivering both help and jobs over the Internet minimizes logistics. An open-sourced YouTube-like app, anybody?

The issue I want to address here is simple - I need somebody to join me in order to make the **hX + jF** more than hobby projects one runs for fun. Can we make them run for profit together?
